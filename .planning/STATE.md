# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-10)

**Core value:** The core `llm-agent` module stays stdlib-only and zero-dep — anyone can `go get` it and read every line. Providers, telemetry, and reference services live in sister repos so users opt into deps one package at a time.
**Current focus:** Phase 6 has opened; bootstrap work is underway in the reference service repo that composes the now-finished OTel adapter

## Current Position

Phase: 6 of 7 (reference customer-support service) — execution opened 2026-05-11
Previous phase: 5 — OTel adapter — ✓ COMPLETE 2026-05-11
Plan: 3 of 8 in Phase 6
Status: Phase 6 plans `06-01` through `06-03` are complete in `llm-agent-customer-support`. The repo now has config loading, provider-aware model bootstrap, independent embedding-provider selection, OTel tracer-provider wiring, wrapped-agent construction, graceful shutdown, and the first real HTTP transport surface (`/chat`, `/chat/stream`, `/healthz`, `/readyz`, `X-Trace-Id`).
Last activity: 2026-05-11 — completed Phase 6 plan `06-03` in `llm-agent-customer-support` and recorded verification evidence.

Progress: [█████░░░░░] 62% (5 of 8 phases complete)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 11
- Average duration: -
- Total execution time: -

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 | 7 | - | - |
| 2 | 4 | - | - |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 05-01, 05-02, 05-03, 05-04, 05-05 completed
- Trend: provider and observability substrate work is closed; focus has moved to service integration and guardrails in the reference service repo

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 0 (planned): Hybrid walking-skeleton build order RATIFIED (Conflict A) — Generate → Stream → Tools → Embeddings across all 3 providers in lockstep; OpenAI leads each gate.
- Phase 0 (planned): `ProviderInfo` per-(provider × model) via construction-time model binding RATIFIED (Conflict B; locks CORE-06 + K2).
- Phase 0 (planned): `replace` directives = README escape hatch (INFRA-06) AND CI release-gate (INFRA-04). No conflict — both ship.
- Phase 6 (planned): K8s OUT of v0.3 scope (Conflict D resolved). PROJECT.md Active list flagged for cleanup at next `/gsd-transition`.
- Phase 7 is calendar-gated, not effort-gated — depends on a complete v0.3.0 cycle and one minor cycle of deprecation window.
- Phase 1 close: live Ollama verification is nightly-only by design; PR CI remains fixture-driven and Docker-free.
- Phase 1 close: `PROVIDER_AUTHORING.md` is now the canonical Generate-only third-party adapter contract.
- Phase 2 close: shared streaming conformance is now the contract gate before Phase 3 native tool-calling work.
- Phase 3 open: provider-native tools land before any core agent refactor; agent constructors consume capability interfaces, not provider names.
- Phase 3 plan 01 close: OpenAI tool support is modeled as a truthful capability on the bound provider/model, while actual tool attachment remains immutable per `WithTools(...)`.
- Phase 3 plan 02 close: Anthropic stays on the low-level Messages API rather than SDK `BetaToolRunner`; this preserves our adapter contract and concurrent-safety expectations.
- Phase 3 plan 03 close: Ollama tool support is now driven by a per-model strategy table; unsupported models fail honestly instead of silently degrading to free-text.
- Phase 3 plan 04 close: shared conformance now enforces calculator tool calls, parallel/multi-block behavior, capability-degrade, and dedupe-key invariants across providers.
- Phase 3 plan 05 close: core agents now bind to `llm.ChatModel`; `ReAct` selects native tools only when `ToolCaller` and `Capabilities.Tools` both hold, while `FunctionCallAgent` is native-only and rejects chat-only models at construction.
- Phase 4 close: provider embeddings now use the same capability-negotiation idiom as chat and tools; Anthropic's absence remains explicit contract data, not a hidden limitation.
- Phase 5 planning open: OTel stays in the sister repo, wrappers preserve capability interfaces, and semconv/content-capture/cardinality rules must land before any refsvc integration.
- Phase 5 plan 01 close: `otelmodel.Wrap(...)` now preserves `ToolCaller` / `Embedder` / `StructuredOutputs`, rewraps immutable bound models with the same tracer provider, and emits single-operation spans for generate/stream paths.
- Phase 5 plan 02 close: `otelagent.Wrap(...)` now preserves the public `Agent` contract and emits an `invoke_agent` root with bounded `chat` / `execute_tool` child spans driven only from streamed step events.
- Phase 5 plan 03 close: `gen_ai.*` constants and opt-in gates now live in one root file, metrics are emitted through a strict allowlist that excludes `user.id` / `session.id`, and content capture stays off by default with redaction support when enabled.
- Phase 5 plan 04 close: `otelslog.NewHandler(...)` now decorates any `slog.Handler` with `trace_id` / `span_id` correlation while preserving existing structured fields, including `gen_ai.*` keys.
- Phase 5 plan 05 close: OTLP exporter wiring now defaults to HTTP on `:4318`, a compose demo using `grafana/otel-lgtm` exists, and the README documents wrapper usage, opt-in semantics, defaults, and demo verification.
- Phase 6 plan 01 close: the reference service repo now has a thin but runnable bootstrap layer. Config loading, provider-aware model construction, OTel wrappers, signal-aware startup, and graceful shutdown are in place before the HTTP API layer lands.
- Phase 6 plan 02 close: the first transport surface is now wired. JSON chat, SSE chat streaming, health/readiness probes, and `X-Trace-Id` response propagation all share the same wrapped runtime.
- Phase 6 plan 03 close: chat and embedding provider selection are now independent. Anthropic chat plus OpenAI/Ollama embeddings is an explicit supported bootstrap combination, and provider selection logic is centralized in `internal/providers`.

### Pending Todos

[From .planning/todos/pending/ — ideas captured during sessions]

- **PROJECT.md cleanup**: move "Optional Kubernetes manifests / Helm chart variant" from `### Active` to `### Out of Scope` at next `/gsd-transition` (per Conflict D resolution).
- ~~**Out-of-band Phase 0 close**: `git tag v0.3.0-pre.1 && git push --tags`~~ — ✓ done 2026-05-10.
- **Manual GitHub UI**: enable branch protection on `main` for the 3 sister repos (Settings → Branches → require status checks).
- **Post-merge workflow smoke test**: trigger `nightly-ollama-live` via `workflow_dispatch` after merge to validate GitHub-hosted Docker + cache behavior on the first real run.

### Blockers/Concerns

No current blocker. Immediate work is `06-04` in `llm-agent-customer-support`: replace the simple-agent bootstrap path with the real customer-support flow using RAG, `StateGraph`, and tools.
